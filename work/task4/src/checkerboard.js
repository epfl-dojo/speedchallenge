 * The cases should be filled with a chequered pattern: half of the cases should be “empty”
 * (they contain spaces), and the other half should be “filled” (they contain # characters).
 * The top left case is always empty.
 *
 * The borders around the cases should be drawn, using - characters for horizontal borders,
 * | characters for vertical borders and + characters for intersections.
 *
 * @param {Number} dim  The dimension of the checkerboard (the number of cases in one direction).
 * @param {Number} size The dimension of a single case (how many characters wide and tall it should be).
 *
 * @return {String} The ASCII art checkerboard
