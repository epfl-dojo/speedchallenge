# Swiss Skills 2020 / Speed Challenge / Trade 17 / Web Technologies

## General information

In the speed challenge you will prove various skills in a range of small
independent tasks.

You have exactly 1 hour to complete as many tasks as possible. The points you
score in the speed challenge will get added to your total points of the whole
competition.

Your solutions will be automatically marked on a central server in real-time.
The first 3 competitors that complete all tasks get awarded some extra points
(3 points for the winner, 2 points for the second place and 1 point for the
third place). If time runs out before someone was able complete all tasks,
the competitors with the most points are awarded the extra points. You can
also continue working on the speed challenge if other competitors are already
finished as those points will still get added to your total competition points.

All tasks can be tested by automated tests. To run them, change into their
folder (e.g. cd `/home/student/ICTT17/speedchallenge/work/task1`) and execute
the command stated in each task under expected result.

Before your start, please check that your name in
`/home/student/ICTT17/speedchallenge/competitor.json` is correct. If it is not,
please call an expert.

You can only change existing files in the `speedchallenge/work/task*/src/`
folders (where * is a number). All other files will be reverted for the review
process.
